# New_York_City_Restaurant_Inspection

# Background

Studies for food safety focus on risk assessment, classification of food safety events, identification of added material to food products, and the design of food safety warning systems. Food may be contaminated by many safety hazards at the same time. Predicting and detecting such hazards can help control them at an earlier stage. Food safety prediction can be done in 2 ways namely focusing on general food safety hazards given direct information from monitoring records and predicting food safety events given information relating directly by consumers such as complaints and reports.Most approaches focus on detecting the presence of contaminants in the food and not on consumer complaints or health inspection records.

# Motivation

Food Safety : practices observed during processing, handling, and distribution of food to ensure absence of illnesses causing contaminants.

Ensures health and safety of consumers.

According to WHO, 600 million people infected with foodborne illnesses after consuming unsanitary foods. Of these, at least 420,000 people die each year.

Aim : use data mining and machine learning on restaurant inspection data from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to classify the violations of the restaurants as critical or not critical, predict the inspection grade, and find useful patterns in the data.
